# Nilang

Nilang is a programming language compiler built entirely from scratch. It is designed as a strictly-typed language with a primary focus on functions.

### Key Features:
- **Strictly Typed Language:** Ensures type safety and clarity in code.
- **Function-Centric:** Functions are the core building blocks.
- **GNU Assembly Output:** The compiler generates GNU assembly code.
- **Linux Compatibility:** Compiled binaries are tested and optimized for Linux environments.

*Note: The syntax for Nilang is still under development.*
